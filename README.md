# RHEL Image Builder Role

[![License: GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Ansible role for building RHEL images with Image Builder.

## Quick Usage Example

This role builds custom RHEL images with
[RHEL Image Builder](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_a_customized_rhel_system_image/index).
The role uses a given image blueprint from a Git repository and stores
results on the build host.

To install this collection from GitHub:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/myllynen/rhel-image,master
```

Next, in a blueprint repository customize an image blueprint:

```
vi base-image.toml
git commit -m "Update base-image" base-image.toml
git push
```

Then, create a [playbook](image_builder.yml) to use this role:

```
---
- name: Build RHEL image with Image Builder
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    rhel_image_create_user: false
    rhel_image_git_remote_repo: file:///tmp/rhel-image-blueprints.git
    rhel_image_git_repo_checkout: master
    rhel_image_blueprint: base-image
    rhel_image_size_kb: 20480
    rhel_image_output_type: qcow2
    rhel_image_download_dir: /tmp/images
  roles:
    - myllynen.rhel_image.rhel_image
```

See
[roles/rhel_image/defaults/main.yml](roles/rhel_image/defaults/main.yml)
for all the supported parameters.

Finally, build the image on a build host:

```
ansible-playbook -i 192.168.122.123, image_builder.yml
```

## Usage with Satellite
The default configuration for image builder is hard coded to point to the main Red Hat CDN. For usage directly against a Satellite server or Capsule, a few modifications are required. These are documented at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5773421.

The following additional role variables can be used to setup the build host to pull from an alternate CDN location:
```
rhel_image_use_alternate_cdn: true
rhel_image_cdn_baseurl: satellite.example.com/pulp/repos/org_name/env_name/cv_name
```
